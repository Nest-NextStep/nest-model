# Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning path aimed at predicting a student's major based on various input features.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the major a student is likely to choose. The prediction is based on a variety of factors including RIASEC test, VCL test, and TIPI test.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from an open-source dataset available on Kaggle ([here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lucasgreenwell/holland-code-riasec-test-responses))

## Model

The final model used for predicting the student's major is a Neural Network with model architecture:
